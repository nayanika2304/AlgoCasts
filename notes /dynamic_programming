FAST method

TOP DOWN Approach
F - Find the recursive solution
A - Analyze the solution
S - Save the results for future (use n - dimensional array for caching)

BOTTOM UP Approach
T - Tweak the solution to make it more powerful by eliminating recursion overhead

-- How can I break down into sub problems and how can I come back up with a global solution

Given an array and we need to find a minimum solution
Longest Increasing Subsequence
