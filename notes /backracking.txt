1) Our choice:
    what choices are we making at each call of the function
    recursion represents decisions
2) Our constraints:
    When do we stop following a certain path
    when do w not go one way

3) Our goal
    What is our target
    what are we trying to find

goal -> choice -> constraint -> undo
