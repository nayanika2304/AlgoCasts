involves dynamic programming top down or bottom up approach
recursion with dfs is top down approach
bottom up approach ::
 - make a table till the amount needed like 0 to 11
 - for 0 amount will always be 0
 - for rest initially fill all with a placeholder value
 - now going further for 1 we check the solution of the sub problem we solved for 0
 - answer for 0 was 0 and now we add 1 and we get 1 for problem 1
